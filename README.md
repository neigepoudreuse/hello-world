# hello-world

Ben here. Deciding to do something I have wanted to do for many years and learn to develop websites. I previously had some limited experiece of html and css. More recently I have been learning JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQueary and a little PHP through online resources and books. So far it has been challenging, confusing but fun with a great sense of achievment. I am still trying to find my path into the development world, but my goal is to become a junior front end developer.
